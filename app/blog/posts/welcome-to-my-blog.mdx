Hello and welcome to my blog!

I've been meaning to start a personal blog for a while now, and I finally got around to it. Instead of building everything from scratch, I decided to use [Vercel's blog template](https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/solutions/blog) as a starting point. It's a clean, minimal template that gave me exactly what I needed to get started quickly.

## The Tech Stack

This blog is built with:

- **Next.js** - React framework for the frontend
- **MDX** - Markdown with JSX support for writing posts
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Vercel** - For hosting and deployment

I made a few tweaks to personalize it, including adding a theme switcher with the [Tokyo Night](https://github.com/tokyo-night/tokyo-night-vscode-theme) color scheme - one of my favorite themes for coding.

## What to Expect

From now on, I'll be sharing my experiences in software development, personal projects I'm working on, and things I learn along the way. Nothing too fancy - just honest posts about building things and solving problems.

If you'd like to connect or have any questions, feel free to reach out. I'm always happy to meet new people in the dev community.

Thanks for stopping by!
